### Overview
Citopia is a high-performance crowd simulation project featuring detailed daily routines of diverse NPCs in a modern city environment. This project was developed in Swift using the Metal API by Deze Lyu, Paulina Tao, and Christine Kneer.

### Milestones
For Milestone 1, we implemented a simulation of 100,000 characters on a flat plane, with characters of different genders either standing still or walking in random directions at varying intervals. Our system efficiently selects visible characters within the camera frustum, sorts them by distance, and renders between 400 and 1,000 characters closest to the camera, adapting to platform capabilities such as mobile and desktop. The characters move and rotate smoothly, achieving responsive, real-time performance. We also developed an acceleration structure that organizes characters in a grid based on their current positions, although it has yet to be fully utilized. Additionally, we encountered an issue with abrupt transitions between idle and walking animations in the custom game engine’s animation system, which we plan to address in future milestones.
